# EX 50 C function to delete a node from a Doubly Linked List at the beginning of the list.
## DATE:08/05/2025
## AIM: To write a C function to delete a node from a Doubly Linked List at the beginning of the list.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Check if list is empty: If head is NULL, no deletion can be performed.
3. Store the current head node in a temporary pointer for freeing later.
4. Move head to the next node in the list.
5. Update new headâ€™s prev to NULL if the list is not empty after deletion.
6. Free the memory of the original head node.
7. End
  

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Node definition
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* prev;
    struct Node* next;
};

// Function to delete node at the beginning
void deleteAtBeginning(struct Node** head) {
    // Step 1: Check if the list is empty
    if (*head == NULL) {
        printf("List is already empty.\n");
        return;
    }

    // Step 2: Save the current head node
    struct Node* temp = *head;

    // Step 3: Move head to the next node
    *head = (*head)->next;

    // Step 4: If the new head is not NULL, update its prev to NULL
    if (*head != NULL)
        (*head)->prev = NULL;

    // Step 5: Free the old head node
    free(temp);
    printf("Node deleted from beginning.\n");
}

// Utility: Function to insert at beginning for testing
void insertAtBeginning(struct Node** head, int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->prev = NULL;
    newNode->next = *head;

    if (*head != NULL)
        (*head)->prev = newNode;

    *head = newNode;
}

// Utility: Function to print the list
void printList(struct Node* head) {
    struct Node* temp = head;
    printf("List: ");
    while (temp != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", temp->data);
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}

```

## Output:
List: 10 20 30 

Node deleted from beginning.

List: 20 30 

Node deleted from beginning.

List: 30 

Node deleted from beginning.

List: 

List is already empty.


## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
